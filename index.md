## About Me
I am a '26 at Dartmouth College majoring in economics on the honors track.

My main roles on campus are as a research assistant (RA) and a teaching assistant (TA).  During my freshman and sophomore years, I worked with Assistant Professor Xin Qi as a pharmaceutical engineering RA developing antibodies to target Interleukin-33. Most recently, I worked with The Dartmouth Professor in Economics Erzo Luttmer as a public economics RA looking at valuing human lives based on respondentsâ€™ choice between vignettes of life stories where life-time income and age of death are randomized.  I also completed an independent research project as a health economics lead researcher looking at the long-term effects of the ACA Medicaid expansions. I also work as a TA in both the economics and music department.  For fun, I teach piano, work out with my friends, act as a mentor in our Korean students association, and participate as a brother in my fraternity.

## Research
I am interested in studying policy implications through a law and economics lens.
